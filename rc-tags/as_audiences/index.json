You can view trends for audiences, connector actions, badges, and number attribute. You can view trends for a single data value, or view two data values in the same graph. Viewing more than one data value in a graph allows to you compare these data values and look for correlations. You can view the same data value across different time blocks, or compare the trends of two different data values.

The range is the time block for which you want to view data and is calculated in relation to today. There are two main parameters to select: Current and Previous.</p><h3 id=\"current\">Current</h3><p>This refers to the time block that today is contained within.</p><ul><li><strong>Day</strong><br>The current day.</li><li><strong>Week</strong><br>This time block begins from the most recent Sunday and ends on the current day.</li><li><strong>Month</strong><br>This time block begins on the first day of this month and ends on the current day.</li><li><strong>Rolling Day</strong></li><li><strong>Rolling Week</strong></li><li><strong>Rolling Month</strong></li></ul><p>This is the time block before the time block that today is contained within.</p><ul><li><strong>Day</strong><br>The time block for the previous day.

When a visitor joins or leaves an audience, you have the opportunity to take an action in response to that activity. Select the AudienceStream connector you want to use and configure the available actions for the connector.</p><p>AudienceStream connector actions are fueled by audiences. To configure an action, select an audience from a drop-down list.</p><p>Learn more about <a href=\"/server-side/connectors/about/\">setting up connectors</a>.</p><h2 id=\"visitor-retention-time\">Visitor retention time</h2><p>Visitor retention time refers to the length of time that AudienceStream will retain visitor records since their last activity. If a visitor has been inactive for the length of the retention period, the record will be purged from the system. However, each incoming event associated to a visitor record will restart the retention start time.</p><p>Retention time is set in two places: <a href=\"/server-side/administration/account-settings/\">global accout settings</a> and for each audience. The audience retention time, if set, overrides the global setting.</p><p>The overall retention time applied to a visitor is determined by one of the following:</p><p><strong>Longest Audience Retention Time</strong>The longest retention time of the visitor&rsquo;s audiences that have a retention time specified is used (even if this is shorter than the global retention time).</p><p>or</p><p><strong>Global Retention Time</strong>If the visitor is not a member of any audiences with a retention time specified, then the Customer Data Hub global visitor retention time is used.</p><p class=\"note\"><i class=\"fas fa-info-circle\"></i>The maximum allowed visitor and audience retention times are determined by your contract terms.</p><h3 id=\"visitor-retention-time-example\">Visitor retention time example</h3><p>If you have a global visitor retention time of 60 days, all visitor records whose last event activity timestamp is older than 60 days will get purged from AudienceStream. This means the entire visitor record is deleted. If that same visitor were to return and trigger event activity, a new visitor record would be created in AudienceStream.</p><p>To store visitor records longer than your account/profile retention period, the visitor must be added to an audience that has a longer retention time.</p><p>The following example illustrates how visitor retention time works with audiences that have times that are longer and shorter than the global setting.</p><ul><li><strong>Global Visitor Retention Time</strong>: 60 days</li><li><strong>&ldquo;Window Shopper&rdquo; audience retention time</strong>: 30 days</li><li><strong>&ldquo;VIP Purchaser (&gt; $500)&rdquo; audience retention time</strong>: 90 days</li></ul><table><thead><tr><th>Action</th><th>Day</th><th>Days Inactive</th><th>&ldquo;Window Shopper&rdquo;</th><th>&ldquo;VIP Purchaser&rdquo;</th><th>AudienceStream</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Visits Website,<br> browses products</td><td>May 1st</td><td>0</td><td>✓ Added</td><td></td><td>✓ New Record</td></tr><tr><td>N/A</td><td>May 31st</td><td>30</td><td>✗ Removed</td><td></td><td>✗ Purged</td></tr><tr><td>Visits Website,<br> Purchases $550</td><td>Aug 1st</td><td>0</td><td></td><td>✓ Added</td><td>✓ New Record</td></tr><tr><td>N/A</td><td>Sep 30th</td><td>60</td><td></td><td>✓ Retained</td><td>✓ Retained</td></tr><tr><td>N/A</td><td>Oct 30th</td><td>90</td><td></td><td>✗ Removed</td><td>✗ Purged</td></tr></tbody></table>"
